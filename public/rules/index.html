    This is a list of guidelines you should follow if you like keeping your account.<br>
    Just to clarify, these rules apply to ALL content sent by you, including images.
    <h3>
      Be kind and welcoming
    </h3>
    Discrimination, bullying, harassment, etc. will not be tolerated here.
    <h3>
      No spamming or malware
    </h3>
    This rule covers spam and unwanted content of all kinds, as well as malware and adware.
    <h3>
      Keep it SFW
    </h3>
    This is meant to be used at school, and the userbase is mostly under 18. Please keep things clean here.
    This includes links.
    <h3>
      Use common sense
    </h3>
    Don't be a dumbass.
    <h3>
      Moderate your swearing
    </h3>
    You can swear, just try to keep it somewhat clean. 
    Slurs will still get you banned.
    <h3>
      No loopholes
    </h3>
    Breaking this rule will get you banned with no appeal.
    <h3>
      No impersonation
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Do not give out personal information
    </h3>
    Things that count as personal information include (but are not limited to): 
    Your location (anything more specific than the state, 
    this includes the schools you go to and the sports teams you're a part of), 
    last name, phone number, email.
    <h4>
      Punishments are at the moderator handling the situation's discretion.
