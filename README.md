Muenster was never particularly well-supported. It was made mostly as an app to include in Clockwork, the web OS before real web OSes started popping up. It was never well-made, as it was my first real go with Node.js, and server programming in general.

Now that Glitch is shut down, Muenster's servers are now gone. I don't plan on updating this, so it's about time to shut this down. I do plan on making a sort of Discord alternative, but it will likely not be under the name of Redstone Network.

Thanks for everything. I hope to see you soon.
